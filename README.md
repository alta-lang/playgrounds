# Alta Playgrounds
Simple modules that do simple things, written in Alta

Basically, these have been created to prove Alta's usefulness and
useability for real code in real situations, such as compression,
encryption, networking, and more.

## Building
For every module, unless it says differently in the README, all you need to
do to get up an running is run `altac` in the module's folder, like this:
```bash
# -c tells altac to compile after transpiling
altac -c .
```
